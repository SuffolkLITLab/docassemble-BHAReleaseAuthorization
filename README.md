# Problem Identified:
  There is currently an access to justice crisis in America. The legal system has prohibitive costs of entry, and the confusing and overwhelming process just to simply get your day in court on a calendar, can make access what is supposed to be a public resource nearly impossible. So much for justice for all? Not necessarily. Technology is shining a new light of hope, that the promise of equal protection under the law, will actually function in practice as the birth right it was intended to be. Through technologies such as automation and artificial intelligence, legal professionals are able to broaden their reach, and do more good for more people, than ever before. 
    For our project, we set our sights on addressing one of the more dire concerns that lack of equal justice can present: access to safe and affordable housing. The Covid-19 pandemic has been difficult on every single person that has lived through it. But unfortunately, the challenges presented by life under these new conditions, have disproportionately impacted those living with financial hardships. While our critical service infrastructure continue to do all they can given the circumstances, we identified this problem as a ripe opportunity to implement a technology solution.
     We developed three docassemble interviews that will help people seeking assistance in gaining housing through the Boston Housing Authority (BHA), fill out and submit the required documentation faster and more conviniently than ever before. With the help of these mobile friendly, guided interviews, the products we developed will increase access to justice to Boston area residents, seeking to secure housing through BHA. What once may have required access to legal aid services to assist in identifying, locating, drafting, and filing critical documents, necessary to secure housing, can be done in a matter of minutes, with access to a smartphone, a printer, and a stamp. With the help of the amazing team working on the document assemblyline prroject, these products are ready to make an instant impact in the community, and hopefully streamline what can be a very daunting task to undertake alone. 
     
# Current Solutions:
Browsing the current options available to someone in need of help securing affordable housing demonstrates there is 1. absolutely room to improve the status quoe and 2. now may be the perfect time to let these technologies prove their worth in the field. Aside from recieving help from <a href="https://www.metrohousingboston.org/">Other Agencies</a>, there are almsot no products or services that are both free, and particularly effective or timely in solving a housing need.

# Ideation and Prototyping

Knowing all of this, the process of envisioning a solution was fairly straight forward. We identified a need- a product that could provide information and direction, while also making tangible progress toward the user's ultimate goal-getting the correct documents to the appropriate people, so that they can move in to their new home as quickly as possible. After spending sometime comparing the currrent options available (discussed above), we began looking into the document assemblyline project as a possible vehichle to deliver our solution through. We began experimenting with existing interviews to ascertain the capabilities of devloping on docassemble. We discussed what our ideal solution would look like, as well as what would be a succesful minimum viable product. We drew up some wireframes and low-fi mockups of what this app would look like, and how the user flows might run. After several brainstorming sessions, we had our gameplan and began to work towards MVPs for our respective forms. 

# User Testing and Refinement.

One of the major advantages of working in a group was the ample opportunity to constantly test,  provide feedback, and iterate on our forms throughout this process. We were initially considering trying to do a package interview, where one interview could concievably fillout all three forms. While this is still a stretch goal of mine, the scope of that idea proved to be too broad for our purposes. We refocused our sights, and continued to brainstorm ideas to bring the project into digestible bits we could all handle. That is when we arrived at the idea of creating another, standard, release form, that may have morre wide applications than the BHA. We wanted to provide clients with an array of options and avenues to pursue, and having a generic release allowed us to do exactly that. 

One of my favorite aspects about this project, and the nature of this work as a whole, is the constant building and adaptation that occurrs. My earliest "MVPs" were  clumsy and frankly, ugly. Overtime, as the ideas, inspiration, and time made themselves available, I was plesently pleased with the constant march of progress this project took on. By the time we had our external partner review with Professors Colarusso and Steenhuis, I felt good about what I was ready to present. After an extremely insightful and productive sitdown, I went back to my github repo with a laundry list (in a good way) of issues to create and resolve, in the constant growing process that was designing this product. 

Upon implementation of our Partner feedback, we began more structured, capturable user feedback, through testing scenarios, designed to catch all the most difficult "edge cases" the app may need to face. Using a googlesheet to track errors and feedback, I was able to iron out most of the most glaring obstacles between me and a viable MVP. This real-world testing, usinng non-familiar users, proved invaluable for taking an objective view at my product, through the eyes of the average end user. This feedback proved particularly critical in motivating me to include embeded hyperlinks using HTML. I even attempted embedding a google map, pinned on the Occupancy Department (I still have to work out some kinks with that-the map kind of comes and goes as it  wants).
