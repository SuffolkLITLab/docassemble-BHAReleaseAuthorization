# Problem Identified:
  There is currently an access to justice crisis in America. The legal system has prohibitive costs of entry, and the confusing and overwhelming process just to simply get your day in court on a calendar, can make access what is supposed to be a public resource nearly impossible. So much for justice for all? Not necessarily. Technology is shining a new light of hope, that the promise of equal protection under the law, will actually function in practice as the birth right it was intended to be. Through technologies such as automation and artificial intelligence, legal professionals are able to broaden their reach, and do more good for more people, than ever before. 
    For our project, we set our sights on addressing one of the more dire concerns that lack of equal justice can present: access to safe and affordable housing. The Covid-19 pandemic has been difficult on every single person that has lived through it. But unfortunately, the challenges presented by life under these new conditions, have disproportionately impacted those living with financial hardships. While our critical service infrastructure continue to do all they can given the circumstances, we identified this problem as a ripe opportunity to implement a technology solution.
     We developed three docassemble interviews that will help people seeking assistance in gaining housing through the Boston Housing Authority (BHA), fill out and submit the required documentation faster and more conviniently than ever before. With the help of these mobile friendly, guided interviews, the products we developed will increase access to justice to Boston area residents, seeking to secure housing through BHA. What once may have required access to legal aid services to assist in identifying, locating, drafting, and filing critical documents, necessary to secure housing, can be done in a matter of minutes, with access to a smartphone, a printer, and a stamp. With the help of the amazing team working on the document assemblyline prroject, these products are ready to make an instant impact in the community, and hopefully streamline what can be a very daunting task to undertake alone.
